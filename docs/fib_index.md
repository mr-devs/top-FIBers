The FIB-index is a simple yet effective metric for estimating a social media user's influence within a misinformation network on a given platform.

See the working paper for more details: [Matthew R. DeVerna, Rachith Aiyappa, Diogo Pacheco, John Bryden, and Filippo Menczer, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09524).
Should you use the FIB-index in your own work, please cite the latest version of that paper.
