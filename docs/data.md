## Data
This project utilizes data that is output by the Observatory on Social Media's (OSoMe) Decahose infrastructure.

Currently, the data is returned in Twitter's V1 format as this is how data is delivered by the Decahose.
You can see details on migrating from V1 and V2 [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/migrate/data-formats/standard-v1-1-to-v2).
